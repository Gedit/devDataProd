## Course Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch 

Developing Data Products: Course Project

This course project consists of creating a shiny application and its documentation. 

The application is available here: <https://gedit.shinyapps.io/DevDataProducts/> 

The code for server.R and ui.R are available on github: <https://github.com/Gedit/devDataProd> 

Slides: <http://rpubs.com/geri1080/181676>

The shiny application uses the **airquality** data set, which contains air quality and climate data in New York from May to September 1973. The objective of this application is to provide visualization of the data of selected time intervals.

There are four variables in the data set, which can be visualized:
- Ozone (ppb)
- Solar radiation
- Wind (mph)
- Temperature (F)

The user can choose which of the four variables should be visualized in the plot.

The user can also choose which time interval (by month) should be visualized.
