This application uses the **airquality** data set, which contains air quality and climate data in New York from May to September 1973. It provides visualization of the data of desired subsets within a selected time interval.

There are four variables in the data set, which can be visualized and are chosen by the pull down menu **Variable**
- Ozone (ppb)
- Solar radiation
- Wind (mph)
- Temperature (F)

The user can choose which of the four variables should be visualized in the plot.

The slider **Month** can be used to select which months should be displayed (5 = May to 9 = September).

Within the plot, grey dotted lines indicate the beginning of a new month.
